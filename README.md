## My Personal Website  

I created this repository to show my life interests and to demonstrate my learnings from the IT Specialist (ITS) certificate
in HTML & CSS from CENIT College.  
  
I am also currently pursuing an ITS certificate in JavaScript to also integrate into web pages along with HTML & CSS.  

Material to be gradually included in the Home page:  
* Professional Profile,  
* Coursework Timeline,  
* Cars I've owned,  
* Holiday Photos.  

I have created sub-repositories containing HTML, CSS, Docs, Images, Audio & Video data,
linked to web pages each revolving around my specific life interests:  

* Food & Fitness  
* Video Gaming  
* Hama Bead Arts & Crafts  
* Music  
* Otaku (Anime & Manga)  
* Pets & Animals  
* TV & Movies  

I have added various tags from the ITS courses to the web pages, now I will re-organise
and structure these tags amongst the most appropriate web pages.
