        On this website, I will be building several web pages with my life interests, such as video gaming, pets and hama bead creations. <br />
        I have recently completed a certification in HTML &amp; CSS and I wanted to showcase my newly acquired skills for potential employers.

        I have also completed a Higher Diploma in Data Analytics at Atlantic Technological University (ATU) Galway. <br />
        It contained many interesting modules to study, and I found that Web Application Development was the module I wished to further learn about.

        My time in Chemistry (2009 - 2014)
        <br />
        Jonny was a chemist, but Jonny is no more,
        <br />
        Because what he thought was H<sub>2</sub>O was H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.
        <br />
        Jonny's mother, an M.D., gave him CaCO<sub>3</sub>,
        <br />
        Now he's neutralised, it's true, but he is full of CO<sub>2</sub>.

        The following is a sample program in C++ as a reference, as I enter code as text.
        <br />
        <!--var tag displays a variable in the program below-->
        This program assigns an input value to <var>degF</var>, then it
        performs a conversion on that value,
        <br />
        assigning the result to <var>degC</var> for output.
        <br />
        <!--samp tag displays sample input & output from the program below -->
        For example, an input of <samp>98.6</samp>
        will output <samp>37<sup>o</sup>C</samp>.
