                On this website, I will be building several web pages with my life interests.
                <br />
                These interests can be found in the navigation bar above with a link to each.
                <br />
                Links to my Gmail, GitHub and LinkedIn are accessible at the footer of the page.

            <article id="profile">
                I have recently completed a certification in HTML &amp; CSS and I wanted to showcase my newly acquired skills to potential employers.
                <br />
                I am currently studying JavaScript to add to the HTML &amp; CSS certification above.
                <br />
                I have also completed a Higher Diploma in Data Analytics at Atlantic Technological University (ATU) Galway.
                <br />
                It contained many interesting modules to study, but I found that Web Application Development and Applied Databases were the modules I wished to further learn about.

            <h2>Cars</h2>
            <article id="cars">
                Here I would like to display both cars I have purchased.
                <br />
                <img src="images/yaris.jpg" alt="Toyota Yaris!" width="300" height="300" />
                <p id="yaris">
                    I never had an avid interest in driving from a young age, mainly due to the cost of purchasing a car, as well as regularly maintaining it with insurance costs etc just was not feasible for me.
                    <br />
                    Once I dug in and got driving lessons and passed the test, my brother found this lovely starter car for me!
                    <br />
                    A bargain at €500, this Toyota Yaris came with a 1L engine so the tax was very affordable as were the insurance costs.
                </p>
                <br />
                <img src="images/hondafit.jpg" alt="Honda Fit!" width="300" height="300" />
                <p id="hondafit">
                    After 2 years of driving, I could take those Novice stickers off my Yaris!
                    <br />
                    But I wanted to reward myself by upgrading from my reliable Yaris to a more eco-friendly model.
                    <br />
                    Here we have the Honda Fit, imported from Japan (also known as the Honda Jazz in Europe).
                    <br />
                    My brother and I decided to take this for a test drive down in Ennis, and one aspect about the car that excited me was the automatic transmission.
                    <br />
                    I also was interested to learn more about the self-charging hybrid aspect of the Honda Fit, as I felt more eco-friendly cars were appearing around Ireland
                    and I wanted to sample the technology for myself.
                    <br />
                    I found it to be fantastic, the automatic transmission made accelerating so smooth, so seamless compared to manual transmission.
                    I gently push down on the accelerator and the electric motor would move my car forward, as opposed to firmly pushing down which activates the internal combustion engine (ICE).
                    I noticed I have saved quite a chunk of cash on topping up my fuel, I am mindful of how I drive and use of the electric motor requires less fuel to consume compared to traditional means.
